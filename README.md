# Election Analysis

## Project Overiew
Tom, as an employee for Colorado Board of Elections, is looking to for a way to automate reporting on election results for the US Congressional Precinct. For this project, we implemented Python, in order to calculate several data values, such as total election votes, total votes by candidate, and the total votes by county. In the reporting analysis, we are also able to make conclusions on the largest city turnout and candidate winner. Python code can be utilized in reporting of elections at different volumes, allowing faster processing and easier comprehension.

# Election Audit Summary

 Python code provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to analyzing the same type of data at different volumes. In order to provide further detail on the election results, we can introduce an array of custom adjustments to the existing process. By introducing additional filters, we can set up the code to showcase leaders by a specified region or their popularity in each county. In comparison with the Excel format, Python code holds the advantage in how easy it can be manipulated to meet a wide range of requests on the same data set.
